# Minimax_Morpion

## AI project

For this AI project, I decided to implement the Minimax algorithm to a well known game : the tic-tac-toe game.

### Tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe is a game with 2 players, who take turns to mark the spaces of a 3x3 grid. The player who manages to place three of his marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game.

### Minimax

Minimax is a decision rule used in decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy to minimize the possible loss in the worst case scenario (maximum loss). Originally formulated for the theory of two-player zero-sum games, covering both cases where players make alternative moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision making under uncertainty.

### Implementation of the game

This game I implemented is played solo against the computer, which uses the MiniMax algorithm and is therefore unbeatable. Even if the player plays the most optimal move every time, the final result will be almost a draw. Each time a move is made, the computer automatically makes a return move.
